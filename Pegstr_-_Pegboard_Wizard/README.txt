# Summary

    Infinite ways to create pegboard holders and bins for tools or display objects.  
Highlights:   
- One or multiple (mâ€¢n matrix) objects per holder  
- Round, square or rectangular with rounded corners  
- Generate various shapes of bins and trays (closed bottom)  
- Chose between stronger or economical, straight or tapered, etc  
- Can be partially open  (to click / snap in objects) and angled  up or down  

> Note: This is designed to work with US-style pegboard (1/4" holes, 1" spaced) but I'm working on updating the design to support other pegboards requested in the comments.

# Instructions

Print with support! Don't worry, the support is easy to remove and if there any dimples left they will not show once this is mounted on a pegboard. You might need to play with the orientation at times.  
I typically use 3 shells in the slicer, therefore 6 times extrusion width for wall thickness (typ 2.75mm), this generates  very strong supports.  

When printing bottom-up (hooks on the bed) you can also print without supports, and do a bit of clean-up on the straight pins (which are non-critical).
